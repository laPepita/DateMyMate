In an age where meeting people is increasingly done online, we want to provide an authentic, in-person experience for friend groups and social circles to interact and come together in the name of love and comedy. ðŸ¤— ðŸ¤©\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\nWe are always open for a chat, so send us a message on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Date-My-Mate-106605317589661/) and hopefully see you at the next event!  ðŸ˜Ž\n\n<p></p><p></p>",
