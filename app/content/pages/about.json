In an age where dating is digital, we want to provide an authentic, in-person experience for friend groups and social circles to interact and come together in the name of love.\n\nWe aim to create a relaxed and natural atmosphere that provides lighthearted comedy and meaningful introductions.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Banner for Date My Mate](/images/uploads/Long Logo BackgroundM Scott.png)",
