Born out of frustration with the online dating world, we believe better dating experiences start with the hilarious fun of watching friends pitch the best and worst parts of their mates to an audience of potential dates. \n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\nWith the value in watching genuine people put themselves out there we aim to provide an authentic, in-person experience for friend groups and social circles to interact and come together in the name of love and comedy. ðŸ¤— ðŸ¤©\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\nWe are always open for a chat, so send us a message on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Date-My-Mate-106605317589661/) and hopefully see you at the next event!  ðŸ˜ŽCome for the laughs, leave with a date.\n\n<p></p><p></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ.
